What was this task about?
This task was about creating a digitial portfolio on myself for potential employers to see.

What were there biggest challenges of this task?
The biggest challenge of this task was time. I personally, don't feel as though i did the best of my potential with this task, as it was a super busy week. From moving houses to childbirth, I struggled to make this task a priority.

What can be improved in this portfolio?
Some things I'd like to improve is the sizing of images, centering text to make it flow better, more JavaScript usage as well, a better palette would also be amazing.
